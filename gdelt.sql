The clogged streets with their treacherous footpaths might be hard to navigate but they pulse with energy. I love the wit of Indonesians on social media. I love the steamy nights, waking to the call to prayer and the drama of torrential downpours. Anything seems possible here even when so much is bloody difficult. I was recently trapped in floods in Jakarta. The eight-kilometre commute from my office took three hours. As the water lapped against the side of the taxi, the driver got the giggles. It struck me, not for the first time, that no driver in Australia would ever have the sanguinity to laugh about this level of madness. I watched a fleet of green-helmeted Go-Jek motorcycle taxi drivers pick their way through the waves. Go-Jek was Indonesia\'s first unicorn (a start-up with a value of over $1 billion). It\'s the ultimate example of a company making lemonade out of lemons. Go-Jeks do not just ferry passengers around the congested streets, squeezing through spaces cars could only dream about, they also save you from ever having to leave the house. I have Go-Jeked (it\'s a verb here) someone to wax my legs, cut my hair, deliver cranberry juice and drop off a pram I bought online. It arrived exactly 56 minutes later. Indonesia is a country of extraordinary stories. The warmth, openness and generosity so many people have shown me has been incredible. My favourite word in Indonesian is boleh (you may). I heard it so many times – you may interview me, you may come in, you may visit. And yet Indonesia is dogged by problems that can seem insurmountable. Barely a day goes past without a corruption scandal hitting the headlines. Last November 18 officials were suspected of graft relating to the Monument of Integrity erected in Pekanbaru, a city in Sumatra, to mark International Anti-Corruption Day. It was not satire. \"Peak Indonesia,\" someone tweeted.\n\nThere are concerns about rising Islamic conservatism and religious intolerance, with the former Chinese-Indonesian Christian governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama – known as Ahok – jailed for blasphemy last year and an unprecedented crackdown on the nation\'s LGBT community. But there are also unsung heroes everywhere. The Sumatran school doing its bit to tackle the national rubbish crisis by allowing parents to pay fees with recycled rubbish, the Muslims who provide security outside churches at Christmas, the women of Rembang who planted their feet in blocks of concrete outside the presidential palace to protest against the environmental damage caused by a cement factory, the Acehnese fishing communities who welcomed Rohingya refugees when the rest of the world turned its back. Struggling to articulate Indonesia\'s contradictions, I find myself craving my favourite comfort food, martabak manis, a sweet pancake stuffed with chocolate and grated cheddar cheese. It\'s a much loved food combination here I once thought disgusting. Now I snap: \"How is chocolate and cheese any different to caramel and sea salt?\" But unlike my friend\'s instant crush on Indonesia, my relationship with the country was a complicated slow-burner.\n\nJewel Topsfield interviewed Indonesian President Joko Widodo, centre, with Fairfax Media\'s Peter Hartcher, left. Credit:Jefri Tarigan Within days of my arrival, Indonesia\'s president, Joko Widodo, rejected the clemency pleas of Bali Nine heroin smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, despite their remarkable rehabilitation. From this moment their death by firing squad seemed inevitable. Reporting on the lead-up to the executions was like watching a film, heart in mouth, that you already know ends tragically. I barely slept for weeks. Relations between the two countries soured, exacerbated by Tony Abbott\'s disastrous reminder of the billion dollars in aid Australia had donated after the 2004 tsunami.\n\n\"Australia and Indonesia are like divorced parents who have to stay together for the sake of the children,\" one Indonesian official told me. The anger some Australians felt towards Indonesia at the time was visceral. I deplore the death penalty – now more than ever – but felt a responsibility not to fan the flames of hate. Many Indonesians see drug smuggling through a different prism to Australians; a crime akin to cold-blooded murder or terrorism because it can lead to the deaths of addicts. And there were also Indonesians who were deeply affected; among them the guards and fellow prisoners who became close to Chan and Sukumaran and their indefatigable lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis, who has been fighting to end the death penalty in Indonesia since 1979. Mulya would later describe the night the Australians were shot as the darkest moment of his life. \"I failed. I lost,\" he tweeted, heartbroken, at 4am.\n\nFor a long time I didn\'t let myself acknowledge the executions had affected me. It seemed nothing in the face of the grief faced by Chan and Sukumaran\'s loved ones. But I was haunted by photos of them as children, Sukumaran with a broad toothy grin and Chan an impish smirk. For weeks afterwards I dreamed my son, 18 months old at the time, fell into a swimming pool. I would dive in and try to rescue him but each time his slippery, muscular body would squirm out of my hands until I realised I was powerless to save him. I would wake soaked in sweat, again and again. I remember reading former Melbourne radio journalist Brian Morley\'s account of witnessing the hanging of Ronald Ryan in Melbourne and how it changed him. I marvelled he was still alive to tell the story. The last execution carried out in Australia seemed so long ago although it was only 1967. Jokowi last year suggested Indonesians would eventually change their minds on execution laws, as citizens of other countries have done in the past.\n\nI hope one day to write a retrospective piece when the death penalty seems as remote and archaic in Indonesia as it does in Australia. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed in 2015. Credit:Anta Kesuma I still have to pinch myself I got this job. I was terrified when appointed that I would never live up to the previous Fairfax Indonesia correspondents. I poured out my heart to a mentor. \"No two correspondents are the same,\" she said. \"Follow the stories that interest you.\" It sounds so obvious but it is among the best pieces of career advice I have received. Fairfax Media is blessed to have two superb Indonesian journalists – Karuni Rompies and Amilia Rosa – who are gutsy, charming, dogged, unflappable and insatiably curious. Accompanied by either one of them, I criss-crossed the archipelago in search of stories that interested me and (I hope) gave readers some insight into the complexity and wonder of one of Australia\'s closest but least understood neighbours.\n\nIt can be difficult for foreign media to access Papua (the independence struggle here is one of the most sensitive topics in Indonesia) but we reported on the mysterious disappearance of Papuan Martinus Beanal as conflict simmered around the Freeport mine. The area surrounding the mine, which many indigenous Papuans see as the root of their oppression, has long been the site of a low-level insurgency. We wrote about the \"real estate deal of the millennium\": the forgotten Indonesian island of Run in the Banda Sea that was swapped for Manhattan 350 years ago. Run Island, famed for its nutmeg, was once exchanged for Manhattan. Credit:Jefri Tarigan The man expected to challenge Jokowi for the 2019 presidential election, Prabowo Subianto – usually referred to as a \"former military strongman\" – told us over breakfast that his love for animals meant he had to negotiate with ants. We explored Indonesia\'s struggle to come to terms with one of its darkest chapters – the massacre of an estimated 500,000 people suspected of left leanings in 1965 and 1966 – and the surreal paranoia about a resurgent red peril.\n\nWe met terrorist attack survivors, women who formed a support group for those who wear the niqab, religious leaders, fans of Indonesia\'s weird architecture in the 50s and 60s and the president of Indonesia. The access we were granted was extraordinary. In June 2015, Amilia and I travelled to West Timor to investigate vague – but potentially explosive – claims an Australian official had paid people smugglers to return a boat of 65 asylum seekers to Indonesia. I was highly sceptical. Then prime minister Tony Abbott had described people smuggling as an \"evil trade\". Surely Australia would not reward criminal activity? We were ushered into a room at Kupang police station. I was astonished General Endang Sunjaya, the then police chief of East Nusa Tenggara, had agreed to even meet with us.\n\nHe told us the six crew members on the people smuggling boat had all sworn under oath they received about $US5000 from an Australian official to return to Indonesia. Their accounts were corroborated by asylum seekers who were separately interrogated. \"The money is now being kept as evidence that this was not a made-up story,\" General Endang told us. \"This is very unexpected. If it happened in Indonesia it would constitute a bribe.\" I was pouring with sweat and my eyes were beginning to bulge. I frenziedly scribbled a note to Amilia: \"Let\'s get out of here before he changes his mind and says this is all off the record!!!!!\". Amilia calmly ignored me and sipped her tea. \"Could you show us the money sir?\" she asked sweetly. \"Boleh,\" the general replied and showed us photographs of piles of crisp US dollar notes. Later Amilia, bemused by my shock, asked if the Australian government was likely to respond. I said it would almost certainly not comment \"on water matters\". Sure enough Abbott refused to comment on \"operational matters\", although he never denied Australia had paid the people smugglers. \"What we do is we stop the boats by hook or by crook,\" he said. \"I just don\'t want to go into the details of how it\'s done.\"\n\nAmusingly, Indonesian journalists were not familiar with the idiom \"by hook or by crook\" and translated it literally. \"Abbott simply insisted that he would \'stop the boat by inducement or with criminals\' and refused to elaborate on \'how it is done\',\" Antara news reported. I\'ll always be grateful for the refreshing – and generous – level of access that Indonesian officials have provided to us over the past three years. It is a world away from the team of media flacks employed to massage the message back home. We won a Walkley Award for our coverage of the cash for boat turnbacks scandal and it triggered a Senate inquiry. From left, seated: Captain Yohanis Humiang with head of the people smuggling division of Nusa Tenggara Timur, Ibrahim, and Rote police chief Hidayat. Analysts have claimed Indonesia has been at a crossroads for so long it has been parodied by The Simpsons. \"Look at me, I\'m reading The Economist. Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?\" Homer asks, after ordering a steak on a plane. \"Nooooo,\" deadpans Marge.\n\nBut once again things seem precarious. Identity politics in Indonesia (and other southern Asian countries) has been named one of the top global risks for 2018 by US risk analysis organisation the Eurasia Group. Islamists\' increasing sway over Indonesian politics was demonstrated in the lead-up to last year\'s gubernatorial election, with massive street protests denouncing the reformist Chinese-Christian governor Ahok. The allegations Ahok had insulted Islam and his subsequent blasphemy trial proved catastrophic for his re-election bid despite polls showing that Jakartans were overwhelmingly satisfied with his performance in office. Former Jakarta governor Basuki \'\'Ahok\'\' Tjahaja Purnama. Credit:AP\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 Islamist mobilisation has been recognised as an important shift in Indonesian politics. A new paper by Australian National University academic Marcus Mietzner and others says opposition to non-Muslims holding political office has hardened. All eyes will be on the 171 provincial elections in June which are likely to be a bellwether of the 2019 presidential elections. Already there are fears religion, ethnicity and race will be used to sway voters. I will be watching with bated breath. After three years reporting on politics I feel personally invested. I recently met a man who had a map of Indonesia tattooed across his face to reflect his love for his country. He was an environmental activist working in a remote village in Bogor regency to turn plastic rubbish into fuel. This powered a generator and provided electricity for the village. I thought it would make a great story. The tattooed man who loved his country trying to tackle Indonesia\'s trash crisis. And then it struck me I had run out of time.');

The clogged streets with their treacherous footpaths might be hard to navigate but they pulse with energy. I love the wit of Indonesians on social media. I love the steamy nights, waking to the call to prayer and the drama of torrential downpours. Anything seems possible here even when so much is bloody difficult. I was recently trapped in floods in Jakarta. The eight-kilometre commute from my office took three hours. As the water lapped against the side of the taxi, the driver got the giggles. It struck me, not for the first time, that no driver in Australia would ever have the sanguinity to laugh about this level of madness. I watched a fleet of green-helmeted Go-Jek motorcycle taxi drivers pick their way through the waves. Go-Jek was Indonesia\'s first unicorn (a start-up with a value of over $1 billion). It\'s the ultimate example of a company making lemonade out of lemons. Go-Jeks do not just ferry passengers around the congested streets, squeezing through spaces cars could only dream about, they also save you from ever having to leave the house. I have Go-Jeked (it\'s a verb here) someone to wax my legs, cut my hair, deliver cranberry juice and drop off a pram I bought online. It arrived exactly 56 minutes later. Indonesia is a country of extraordinary stories. The warmth, openness and generosity so many people have shown me has been incredible. My favourite word in Indonesian is boleh (you may). I heard it so many times – you may interview me, you may come in, you may visit. And yet Indonesia is dogged by problems that can seem insurmountable. Barely a day goes past without a corruption scandal hitting the headlines. Last November 18 officials were suspected of graft relating to the Monument of Integrity erected in Pekanbaru, a city in Sumatra, to mark International Anti-Corruption Day. It was not satire. \"Peak Indonesia,\" someone tweeted.\n\nThere are concerns about rising Islamic conservatism and religious intolerance, with the former Chinese-Indonesian Christian governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama – known as Ahok – jailed for blasphemy last year and an unprecedented crackdown on the nation\'s LGBT community. But there are also unsung heroes everywhere. The Sumatran school doing its bit to tackle the national rubbish crisis by allowing parents to pay fees with recycled rubbish, the Muslims who provide security outside churches at Christmas, the women of Rembang who planted their feet in blocks of concrete outside the presidential palace to protest against the environmental damage caused by a cement factory, the Acehnese fishing communities who welcomed Rohingya refugees when the rest of the world turned its back. Struggling to articulate Indonesia\'s contradictions, I find myself craving my favourite comfort food, martabak manis, a sweet pancake stuffed with chocolate and grated cheddar cheese. It\'s a much loved food combination here I once thought disgusting. Now I snap: \"How is chocolate and cheese any different to caramel and sea salt?\" But unlike my friend\'s instant crush on Indonesia, my relationship with the country was a complicated slow-burner.\n\nJewel Topsfield interviewed Indonesian President Joko Widodo, centre, with Fairfax Media\'s Peter Hartcher, left. Credit:Jefri Tarigan Within days of my arrival, Indonesia\'s president, Joko Widodo, rejected the clemency pleas of Bali Nine heroin smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, despite their remarkable rehabilitation. From this moment their death by firing squad seemed inevitable. Reporting on the lead-up to the executions was like watching a film, heart in mouth, that you already know ends tragically. I barely slept for weeks. Relations between the two countries soured, exacerbated by Tony Abbott\'s disastrous reminder of the billion dollars in aid Australia had donated after the 2004 tsunami.\n\n\"Australia and Indonesia are like divorced parents who have to stay together for the sake of the children,\" one Indonesian official told me. The anger some Australians felt towards Indonesia at the time was visceral. I deplore the death penalty – now more than ever – but felt a responsibility not to fan the flames of hate. Many Indonesians see drug smuggling through a different prism to Australians; a crime akin to cold-blooded murder or terrorism because it can lead to the deaths of addicts. And there were also Indonesians who were deeply affected; among them the guards and fellow prisoners who became close to Chan and Sukumaran and their indefatigable lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis, who has been fighting to end the death penalty in Indonesia since 1979. Mulya would later describe the night the Australians were shot as the darkest moment of his life. \"I failed. I lost,\" he tweeted, heartbroken, at 4am.\n\nFor a long time I didn\'t let myself acknowledge the executions had affected me. It seemed nothing in the face of the grief faced by Chan and Sukumaran\'s loved ones. But I was haunted by photos of them as children, Sukumaran with a broad toothy grin and Chan an impish smirk. For weeks afterwards I dreamed my son, 18 months old at the time, fell into a swimming pool. I would dive in and try to rescue him but each time his slippery, muscular body would squirm out of my hands until I realised I was powerless to save him. I would wake soaked in sweat, again and again. I remember reading former Melbourne radio journalist Brian Morley\'s account of witnessing the hanging of Ronald Ryan in Melbourne and how it changed him. I marvelled he was still alive to tell the story. The last execution carried out in Australia seemed so long ago although it was only 1967. Jokowi last year suggested Indonesians would eventually change their minds on execution laws, as citizens of other countries have done in the past.\n\nI hope one day to write a retrospective piece when the death penalty seems as remote and archaic in Indonesia as it does in Australia. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed in 2015. Credit:Anta Kesuma I still have to pinch myself I got this job. I was terrified when appointed that I would never live up to the previous Fairfax Indonesia correspondents. I poured out my heart to a mentor. \"No two correspondents are the same,\" she said. \"Follow the stories that interest you.\" It sounds so obvious but it is among the best pieces of career advice I have received. Fairfax Media is blessed to have two superb Indonesian journalists – Karuni Rompies and Amilia Rosa – who are gutsy, charming, dogged, unflappable and insatiably curious. Accompanied by either one of them, I criss-crossed the archipelago in search of stories that interested me and (I hope) gave readers some insight into the complexity and wonder of one of Australia\'s closest but least understood neighbours.\n\nIt can be difficult for foreign media to access Papua (the independence struggle here is one of the most sensitive topics in Indonesia) but we reported on the mysterious disappearance of Papuan Martinus Beanal as conflict simmered around the Freeport mine. The area surrounding the mine, which many indigenous Papuans see as the root of their oppression, has long been the site of a low-level insurgency. We wrote about the \"real estate deal of the millennium\": the forgotten Indonesian island of Run in the Banda Sea that was swapped for Manhattan 350 years ago. Run Island, famed for its nutmeg, was once exchanged for Manhattan. Credit:Jefri Tarigan The man expected to challenge Jokowi for the 2019 presidential election, Prabowo Subianto – usually referred to as a \"former military strongman\" – told us over breakfast that his love for animals meant he had to negotiate with ants. We explored Indonesia\'s struggle to come to terms with one of its darkest chapters – the massacre of an estimated 500,000 people suspected of left leanings in 1965 and 1966 – and the surreal paranoia about a resurgent red peril.\n\nWe met terrorist attack survivors, women who formed a support group for those who wear the niqab, religious leaders, fans of Indonesia\'s weird architecture in the 50s and 60s and the president of Indonesia. The access we were granted was extraordinary. In June 2015, Amilia and I travelled to West Timor to investigate vague – but potentially explosive – claims an Australian official had paid people smugglers to return a boat of 65 asylum seekers to Indonesia. I was highly sceptical. Then prime minister Tony Abbott had described people smuggling as an \"evil trade\". Surely Australia would not reward criminal activity? We were ushered into a room at Kupang police station. I was astonished General Endang Sunjaya, the then police chief of East Nusa Tenggara, had agreed to even meet with us.\n\nHe told us the six crew members on the people smuggling boat had all sworn under oath they received about $US5000 from an Australian official to return to Indonesia. Their accounts were corroborated by asylum seekers who were separately interrogated. \"The money is now being kept as evidence that this was not a made-up story,\" General Endang told us. \"This is very unexpected. If it happened in Indonesia it would constitute a bribe.\" I was pouring with sweat and my eyes were beginning to bulge. I frenziedly scribbled a note to Amilia: \"Let\'s get out of here before he changes his mind and says this is all off the record!!!!!\". Amilia calmly ignored me and sipped her tea. \"Could you show us the money sir?\" she asked sweetly. \"Boleh,\" the general replied and showed us photographs of piles of crisp US dollar notes. Later Amilia, bemused by my shock, asked if the Australian government was likely to respond. I said it would almost certainly not comment \"on water matters\". Sure enough Abbott refused to comment on \"operational matters\", although he never denied Australia had paid the people smugglers. \"What we do is we stop the boats by hook or by crook,\" he said. \"I just don\'t want to go into the details of how it\'s done.\"\n\nAmusingly, Indonesian journalists were not familiar with the idiom \"by hook or by crook\" and translated it literally. \"Abbott simply insisted that he would \'stop the boat by inducement or with criminals\' and refused to elaborate on \'how it is done\',\" Antara news reported. I\'ll always be grateful for the refreshing – and generous – level of access that Indonesian officials have provided to us over the past three years. It is a world away from the team of media flacks employed to massage the message back home. We won a Walkley Award for our coverage of the cash for boat turnbacks scandal and it triggered a Senate inquiry. From left, seated: Captain Yohanis Humiang with head of the people smuggling division of Nusa Tenggara Timur, Ibrahim, and Rote police chief Hidayat. Analysts have claimed Indonesia has been at a crossroads for so long it has been parodied by The Simpsons. \"Look at me, I\'m reading The Economist. Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?\" Homer asks, after ordering a steak on a plane. \"Nooooo,\" deadpans Marge.\n\nBut once again things seem precarious. Identity politics in Indonesia (and other southern Asian countries) has been named one of the top global risks for 2018 by US risk analysis organisation the Eurasia Group. Islamists\' increasing sway over Indonesian politics was demonstrated in the lead-up to last year\'s gubernatorial election, with massive street protests denouncing the reformist Chinese-Christian governor Ahok. The allegations Ahok had insulted Islam and his subsequent blasphemy trial proved catastrophic for his re-election bid despite polls showing that Jakartans were overwhelmingly satisfied with his performance in office. Former Jakarta governor Basuki \'\'Ahok\'\' Tjahaja Purnama. Credit:AP\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 Islamist mobilisation has been recognised as an important shift in Indonesian politics. A new paper by Australian National University academic Marcus Mietzner and others says opposition to non-Muslims holding political office has hardened. All eyes will be on the 171 provincial elections in June which are likely to be a bellwether of the 2019 presidential elections. Already there are fears religion, ethnicity and race will be used to sway voters. I will be watching with bated breath. After three years reporting on politics I feel personally invested. I recently met a man who had a map of Indonesia tattooed across his face to reflect his love for his country. He was an environmental activist working in a remote village in Bogor regency to turn plastic rubbish into fuel. This powered a generator and provided electricity for the village. I thought it would make a great story. The tattooed man who loved his country trying to tackle Indonesia\'s trash crisis. And then it struck me I had run out of time.');

Participants also denounced the passage of legislative measures that outlaw adultery as well as the sharing of information about contraception and sexual education.\n\nRead more of this article\n\nSource: Global Voices\n\n(Visited 130 times, 1 visits today)\n\nComments\n\ncomments');

Through TPPU law we could confiscate their assets without the process of court of law,\" he said.\n\nThe arrest of couriers would not be effective in efforts to eradicate drug trade, he added.\n\nIn the first year of the present government more than 15 drug convicts had been executed but in the past year there was no execution of death row convicts after strong protest from human rightists in the country and international condemnation.\n\nLawmaker of the Commission III of the House of Representatives Ahmad Sahroni said currently the Parliament is seeking to revise the Law on Narcotics as the present law did not succeed in reducing cases of drug abuses in the country.\n\n\"The revision of the law should be supported by the government,\" Sahroni said, adding the present law is not effective in deterring drug traffic and abuses.\n\nA BNN report said the agency unveiled 45,537 drug cases in 2017 with 58,365 suspects arrested in the country. The number of cases are 50 times larger than 868 cases with 1,330 suspects in 2016.\n\nThe number of cases would likely increase if the government would continue to delay revision of the drug law, he added.');

You have voted for a new government, and you have received it.\n\nIMAN Research (IMAN) is now hard at work analysing and finalising a report on the recent general elections, which we will share once it is completed. However, we would like to share some concerns.\n\nWhile Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s appointment of Maszlee Malik, Mohamad Sabu, Dzulkefly Ahmad, and Salahuddin Ayub can be considered strategic — the appointments of these men from religious-based political parties or backgrounds should allay the fears of Islamists and conservatives — this does not mean that we can rest.\n\nIn an opinion piece by Matthew Hays and Daniel Twin, published in the Nikkei Asian Review on May 24, 2018, “Malaysia’s triumph of democracy remains precarious. The new coalition government faces the daunting challenge of reforming a political system founded on majoritarian rule, cronyism and corruption. The previous ruling party manipulated political Islamism for electoral advantage, compounding risks posed by returning Malaysian extremists who fought with Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

To build a stable government capable of delivering promised reforms, PH will have to overcome its long history of infighting, reject traditional personality-based politics, and bridge racial and religious divides within Malaysian society. This includes promoting values of pluralism to reinforce community cohesion; supporting initiatives that build trust between citizens of different backgrounds is one way of fostering these principles.”\n\n“The new government must tackle the threat posed by Islamist extremist elements who have seized upon Malaysia’s drift toward intolerance. Malaysia is being used as a logistical and financial hub by extremist groups, including the Islamic State, operating across South-east Asia. The politicization of religion has created fertile ground for IS recruiters to actively target young Malaysians (the country’s average age is 28) through social media and at local universities.”\n\nDear Pakatan Harapan, allow us to give you a quick low down on recent events:\n\nRegional terrorism\n\nDuring the time of the Malaysian general elections, a series of bombings struck three churches in Surabaya, the second largest city in Indonesia. The bombings took place at Gereja Katolik Santa Maria, Gereja Kristen Indonesia, and Gereja Pantekosta Pusat Surabaya. The bombings did not end there; a fourth bomb detonated at an apartment complex in Sidoarjo and another one at the Surabaya Police Headquarters. This is the biggest incident of terrorist attacks in Indonesia since the Bali bombing in 2002. Prior to this incident, a deadly riot took place at the Mako Brimob facility in Depok, outside of Jakarta. The inmates, who were identified as violent extremist offenders, took hostage and killed five of Indonesia’s elite counterterrorism squad Densus 88. This series of incidents must be taken seriously by Malaysia not only due to our proximity to our Indonesian neighbour, but also due to the possibility of a shared network among the Indonesian militants and militants here. The perpetrators in Surabaya were allegedly returning fighters from Syria. Since the fall of IS in Syria, the issue of returnees has been one of the major concerns in CT and CVE, especially so in Malaysia as we have porous borders and an open-door policy.\n\nThe gubernatorial elections in Jakarta last year, is another signpost we need to look out for. Indonesia is becoming a hardline Muslim country, contrary to its previous moderate and progressive image. From our conversations with militant groups and hardliners in Indonesia, Malaysia is seen as an example of a purer Muslim state that practises a more conservative Islam that Indonesia sorely needs.\n\nIn the Marawi siege which happened last year, hundreds of soldiers, civilians and Islamist militants have been killed and more than 200,000 families were displaced by the clashes. These attacks and many more in other countries in South-east Asia have shown an increasing presence of IS. An estimated of 1,000 Indonesians travelled to join IS. In 2017, 240 Indonesians were detained and deported in transit countries en-route to join IS — 70 per cent were women and children. IPAC reported 45 Indonesian migrant workers in Hong Kong engaged by IS. These women and the recent handful arrests of female terrorist suspects, have confirmed that violent extremism is no longer the field of masculinity. The shift of radicalization trend has led women to become both perpetrators and victims of violent extremism organization. There is robust discussion as to how Marawi fell to IS’ ‘charms’ — the marginalisation of the Muslim minority in Marawi had led to this siege.\n\nIslam in Malaysia\n\nA survey commissioned by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute last year on the role of Islam and its governance in Johor has shown Malays in the state are becoming more religiously conservative, the Straits Times (ST) reported. It said most Johorean Malays preferred Muslims in key leadership positions, while three in four were supportive of hudud, the Islamic criminal punishment that includes stoning for adultery and amputation for theft.\n\nMalays are increasingly identifying themselves by their religion first over their ethnicity or nationality, Merdeka Center said in 2015. 60 per cent of Malay respondents identify as Muslims, while 27 per cent of them identify as Malaysians. In comparison, only 3 per cent of the ethnic Chinese identify themselves by religious identity, while 16 per cent of ethnic Indians do so. Also, Merdeka Centre in 2014 found the highest level of support for hudud among Malay voters under the age of 30, consistent with Merdeka Center’s findings in its 2011 study of Muslim youth sentiments. However, While Malay Malaysians show high support for the hudud — or Islamic penal law — the majority of citizens feel the country is not ready to implement it.\n\nIMAN in their ongoing nationwide focus group discussion with youths aged 18 to 30 found that participants agreed that their identity is an important component, but yet at the same time feel that it is a very complex issue. Irrespective of the respondents’ religiosity, all answered that their main identity was being Muslim. A worrying finding was the fact many do not have interaction with non-Muslims. They acknowledge that this limits their understanding of issues and concerns faced by non-Muslims but nevertheless find it difficult to overcome. Lastly, participants agreed that the belief in the concept of an Islamic state was an integral part of being a Muslim. While most had different interpretations of how to achieve an Islamic state, what they agreed most on is that if Islamic State did exist then the current problems faced by the country would be solved such as corruption, unscrupulous leaders.\n\nThe Islamist Party of Malaysia (PAS) in 2016 has sought to amend the act RU 355. The amendment seeks to replace section 2 of the act with new sections 2 and 2A. The (proposed) new Section 2 provides: “2. The Syariah Court shall have jurisdiction over persons professing the religion of Islam in respect of offences regarding matters listed in Item 1 of the State List of the Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution.” The (proposed) new section 2A provides: “2A. In the exercise of the criminal law under Section 2, the Syariah Court is entitled to impose penalties allowed by Syariah in relation to offences listed under the section mentioned above, other than the death penalty.” What is more important is the proposed new section 2A. The most noticeable difference between the proposed section 2A and the existing law is that the latter contains a proviso as follows: “Provided that such jurisdiction shall not be exercised in respect of any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding three years or with any fine exceeding five thousand ringgit or with whipping exceeding six strokes or with any combination thereof.” The State Legislative Assembly may make laws empowering the Syariah Court to impose punishments permitted by Islamic law (Syariah and fiqh) including hudud and qisas, except the death penalty. That is the effect. But, how far the State Legislative Assembly may create offences punishable with such penalties is another matter.\n\nIn 2016, a Muslim human rights group called for evangelical Christianity to be ‘banned’, while the Selangor State Assembly speaker Hannah Yeoh was accused of using her biography to proselytise Muslims — a legal offence in Malaysia. In Sabah and Sarawak, native Christian parents have repeatedly complained that Islamic religious teachers attempt to convert their children to Islam. Such distrust is evidenced in the public outcry seen after a Muslim religious teacher was appointed as principal of a mission school in Sarawak. 60 years of racist and racial indoctrination have become part and parcel of Malaysia’s DNA. Inter-faith and intra-faith dialogues are still much needed. Engagement with grassroot communities are important, but one community that has yet to be tapped would be the community religious leaders and preachers.\n\nWith all due respect to the current prime minister who has been away from ruling a country for 15 years, he will have his hands full with the current regional and national security threats. The mentioned events are close to home, and it will need an empathetic, holistic approach to countering violent extremism (CVE) in the region. Malaysia’s role in Asean is more than just trade and forging ties with other countries; Malaysia will need to step up on her role as a serious CVE player, and realising her role as a leader of a Muslim country, and that much of the CVE work in the region involves Muslims, Malaysia will have to take charge of regional and global security, and Muslim matters in the region.\n\nSelamat Hari Raya, Tun. And welcome back. We are in for a wild ride.\n\n*Dina Zaman is a founding member and director of IMAN Research.');

This includes promoting values of pluralism to reinforce community cohesion; supporting initiatives that build trust between citizens of different backgrounds is one way of fostering these principles.”\n\n“The new government must tackle the threat posed by Islamist extremist elements who have seized upon Malaysia’s drift toward intolerance. Malaysia is being used as a logistical and financial hub by extremist groups, including the Islamic State, operating across South-east Asia. The politicization of religion has created fertile ground for IS recruiters to actively target young Malaysians (the country’s average age is 28) through social media and at local universities.”\n\nDear Pakatan Harapan, allow us to give you a quick low down on recent events:\n\nRegional terrorism\n\nDuring the time of the Malaysian general elections, a series of bombings struck three churches in Surabaya, the second largest city in Indonesia. The bombings took place at Gereja Katolik Santa Maria, Gereja Kristen Indonesia, and Gereja Pantekosta Pusat Surabaya. The bombings did not end there; a fourth bomb detonated at an apartment complex in Sidoarjo and another one at the Surabaya Police Headquarters. This is the biggest incident of terrorist attacks in Indonesia since the Bali bombing in 2002. Prior to this incident, a deadly riot took place at the Mako Brimob facility in Depok, outside of Jakarta. The inmates, who were identified as violent extremist offenders, took hostage and killed five of Indonesia’s elite counterterrorism squad Densus 88. This series of incidents must be taken seriously by Malaysia not only due to our proximity to our Indonesian neighbour, but also due to the possibility of a shared network among the Indonesian militants and militants here. The perpetrators in Surabaya were allegedly returning fighters from Syria. Since the fall of IS in Syria, the issue of returnees has been one of the major concerns in CT and CVE, especially so in Malaysia as we have porous borders and an open-door policy.\n\nThe gubernatorial elections in Jakarta last year, is another signpost we need to look out for. Indonesia is becoming a hardline Muslim country, contrary to its previous moderate and progressive image. From our conversations with militant groups and hardliners in Indonesia, Malaysia is seen as an example of a purer Muslim state that practises a more conservative Islam that Indonesia sorely needs.\n\nIn the Marawi siege which happened last year, hundreds of soldiers, civilians and Islamist militants have been killed and more than 200,000 families were displaced by the clashes. These attacks and many more in other countries in South-east Asia have shown an increasing presence of IS. An estimated of 1,000 Indonesians travelled to join IS. In 2017, 240 Indonesians were detained and deported in transit countries en-route to join IS — 70 per cent were women and children. IPAC reported 45 Indonesian migrant workers in Hong Kong engaged by IS. These women and the recent handful arrests of female terrorist suspects, have confirmed that violent extremism is no longer the field of masculinity. The shift of radicalization trend has led women to become both perpetrators and victims of violent extremism organization. There is robust discussion as to how Marawi fell to IS’ ‘charms’ — the marginalisation of the Muslim minority in Marawi had led to this siege.\n\nIslam in Malaysia\n\nA survey commissioned by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute last year on the role of Islam and its governance in Johor has shown Malays in the state are becoming more religiously conservative, the Straits Times (ST) reported. It said most Johorean Malays preferred Muslims in key leadership positions, while three in four were supportive of hudud, the Islamic criminal punishment that includes stoning for adultery and amputation for theft.\n\nMalays are increasingly identifying themselves by their religion first over their ethnicity or nationality, Merdeka Center said in 2015. 60 per cent of Malay respondents identify as Muslims, while 27 per cent of them identify as Malaysians. In comparison, only 3 per cent of the ethnic Chinese identify themselves by religious identity, while 16 per cent of ethnic Indians do so. Also, Merdeka Centre in 2014 found the highest level of support for hudud among Malay voters under the age of 30, consistent with Merdeka Center’s findings in its 2011 study of Muslim youth sentiments. However, While Malay Malaysians show high support for the hudud — or Islamic penal law — the majority of citizens feel the country is not ready to implement it.\n\nIMAN in their ongoing nationwide focus group discussion with youths aged 18 to 30 found that participants agreed that their identity is an important component, but yet at the same time feel that it is a very complex issue. Irrespective of the respondents’ religiosity, all answered that their main identity was being Muslim. A worrying finding was the fact many do not have interaction with non-Muslims. They acknowledge that this limits their understanding of issues and concerns faced by non-Muslims but nevertheless find it difficult to overcome. Lastly, participants agreed that the belief in the concept of an Islamic state was an integral part of being a Muslim. While most had different interpretations of how to achieve an Islamic state, what they agreed most on is that if Islamic State did exist then the current problems faced by the country would be solved such as corruption, unscrupulous leaders.\n\nThe Islamist Party of Malaysia (PAS) in 2016 has sought to amend the act RU 355. The amendment seeks to replace section 2 of the act with new sections 2 and 2A. The (proposed) new Section 2 provides: “2. The Syariah Court shall have jurisdiction over persons professing the religion of Islam in respect of offences regarding matters listed in Item 1 of the State List of the Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution.” The (proposed) new section 2A provides: “2A. In the exercise of the criminal law under Section 2, the Syariah Court is entitled to impose penalties allowed by Syariah in relation to offences listed under the section mentioned above, other than the death penalty.” What is more important is the proposed new section 2A. The most noticeable difference between the proposed section 2A and the existing law is that the latter contains a proviso as follows: “Provided that such jurisdiction shall not be exercised in respect of any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding three years or with any fine exceeding five thousand ringgit or with whipping exceeding six strokes or with any combination thereof.” The State Legislative Assembly may make laws empowering the Syariah Court to impose punishments permitted by Islamic law (Syariah and fiqh) including hudud and qisas, except the death penalty. That is the effect. But, how far the State Legislative Assembly may create offences punishable with such penalties is another matter.\n\nIn 2016, a Muslim human rights group called for evangelical Christianity to be ‘banned’, while the Selangor State Assembly speaker Hannah Yeoh was accused of using her biography to proselytise Muslims — a legal offence in Malaysia. In Sabah and Sarawak, native Christian parents have repeatedly complained that Islamic religious teachers attempt to convert their children to Islam. Such distrust is evidenced in the public outcry seen after a Muslim religious teacher was appointed as principal of a mission school in Sarawak. 60 years of racist and racial indoctrination have become part and parcel of Malaysia’s DNA. Inter-faith and intra-faith dialogues are still much needed. Engagement with grassroot communities are important, but one community that has yet to be tapped would be the community religious leaders and preachers.\n\nWith all due respect to the current prime minister who has been away from ruling a country for 15 years, he will have his hands full with the current regional and national security threats. The mentioned events are close to home, and it will need an empathetic, holistic approach to countering violent extremism (CVE) in the region. Malaysia’s role in Asean is more than just trade and forging ties with other countries; Malaysia will need to step up on her role as a serious CVE player, and realising her role as a leader of a Muslim country, and that much of the CVE work in the region involves Muslims, Malaysia will have to take charge of regional and global security, and Muslim matters in the region.\n\nSelamat Hari Raya, Tun. And welcome back. We are in for a wild ride.\n\n*Dina Zaman is a founding member and director of IMAN Research.');

However, we would like to share some concerns.\n\nWhile Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s appointment of Maszlee Malik, Mohamad Sabu, Dzulkefly Ahmad, and Salahuddin Ayub can be considered strategic — the appointments of these men from religious-based political parties or backgrounds should allay the fears of Islamists and conservatives — this does not mean that we can rest.\n\nIn an opinion piece by Matthew Hays and Daniel Twin, published in the Nikkei Asian Review on May 24, 2018, “Malaysia’s triumph of democracy remains precarious. The new coalition government faces the daunting challenge of reforming a political system founded on majoritarian rule, cronyism and corruption. The previous ruling party manipulated political Islamism for electoral advantage, compounding risks posed by returning Malaysian extremists who fought with Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. More broadly, it is unclear whether a democratic transformation can be delivered by a prime minister who previously ruled Malaysia with an iron fist for 22 years.”\n\n“Malaysia’s new leaders must be on guard for the potential of interethnic and political tensions to erupt into conflict, undermining the country’s democratic path.

The overwhelming majority end with guilty verdicts.\n\nLast year, the minority Christian and ethnic Chinese governor of Jakarta, the capital, was convicted of blasphemy and imprisoned for two years after massive street protests over comments seized upon by his political opponents.\n\nJudges imposed the sentence despite prosecutors downgrading the blasphemy charge to a lesser offense. /vvp\n\nRead Next');

Therefore, democratic methods should also be pursued.\n\nOn the other hand, if the declaration allegedly violated the rules because it was held not in the campaign period, Suparji said that the case must be reported to Election Supervisory Board (Bawaslu).\n\nEarlier, National Police has banned declaration of #2019GantiPresiden in Pekabanbaru, Riau and Surabaya, East Java. Police considered the action could disrupt public order.\n\n“National Police states firmly that the notification letter on the action is not accepted and we will disband the event because it can potentially cause disruption to public order and threaten the unity and integrity of the nation,” said National Police\'s spokesman Setyo Wasisto on Sunday (August 26).');

Questions are mounting about what exactly happened and if more could have been done to save lives. The tragedy has highlighted what critics say is a patchy early-warning system to detect tsunamis in the seismically-active Southeast Asian archipelago. \'There was no information about a tsunami recorded by the tide-monitoring station in Palu because it was not working,\' Widjo Kongko, a tsunami expert with the Indonesian government\'s technology agency, told AFP. The station keeps a check on changes in tides and should have detected if destructive waves were headed for the city. After the initial quake, Indonesia\'s geophysics agency - which monitors seismic activity - did issue a tsunami warning but lifted it soon afterwards. It was only later that images emerged of a surging wall of water charging into the coast, flattening buildings and overturning cars. Tide-monitoring stations and data-modelling are the main tools in Indonesia for predicting if a quake has generated a tsunami. But even if all the country\'s stations are working, experts say the network is limited and in any case gives people little time to flee as they only detect waves once they are close to shore. Efforts to improve systems have been beset by problems, from a failure to properly maintain new equipment to bureaucratic bickering. After a quake-tsunami in 2004 off Sumatra island killed 220,000 across the region, with most victims in Indonesia, 22 early-warning buoys were deployed around the country to detect tsunamis. But officials have admitted that they are no longer working after being vandalised and due to a lack of funds for maintenance. In another case, a major project with funding from the US National Science Foundation to deploy high-tech tsunami sensors in a quake-prone part of western Indonesia has been delayed. Louise Comfort, a natural disaster expert from the University of Pittsburgh who has led the American side of the initiative, said that it had been put on hold after disagreement between government agencies and a delay in getting financing. \'It\'s so disheartening and it\'s so sad because we\'ve got the technology, we\'ve got the knowledge, we know we can do it,\' she told AFP. However, others called for a stronger focus on simply teaching people to head to higher ground when a quake hits, rather than on expensive technology which many communities in a developing country like Indonesia cannot afford. \'For a place like Indonesia to try and defend its coastline, education is almost certainly going to outpace technology for the foreseeable future,\' said Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert from Nanyang Technological University\'s Earth Observatory of Singapore. \'Every kid in Indonesia needs to be taught what to do if they are on the coast and there is an earthquake.\' Observers stressed the Indonesian quake was highly complex, and it would not have been easy to predict it would send a tsunami barrelling towards the small community of Palu. The initial tremor was a sideways movement of tectonic plates, rather than the sort of violent upward thrust that would typically generate destructive waves, and was followed by scores of aftershocks. Experts believe that the tsunami could have been triggered by an underwater landslide that followed the tremor. Palu\'s unique geography will not have helped, they said - the tsunami likely intensified as it raced down the narrow bay on which the city sits. \'Geographical factors (the narrow bay, shallow water) seemed to have played major roles,\' said Taro Arikawa, a professor at Chuo University in Tokyo. \'The tsunami must have come very fast and suddenly.\'\n\nInmates had fled from another overcapacity facility in Palu by breaking down its main door and another in Donggala, an area also hit by the disaster.\n\nThe Donggala jail was set on fire and all 343 inmates were now on the run, Utami said.\n\nThe arson was thought to have been sparked by angry detainees demanding to see their families.\n\n\'They panicked after learning that Donggala was badly hit by the earthquake,\' Utami said.\n\n\'Prison officials did negotiate with prisoners about allowing them to go to check on their families.\n\n\'But some prisoners were apparently not patient enough and committed the arson.\'\n\nSome of the convicts were jailed for corruption and narcotics offences, she said.\n\nFive people convicted of terror-related crimes had been moved from the prison just days before the disaster.\n\nJust over 100 prisoners at the two facilities in Palu were still in jail, but overstretched guards were struggling to keep them fed.\n\n\'The prison no longer had enough food,\' Utami said. \'Officials then tried to buy supplies from stores around the prison that were still open.\'\n\nNearly all of those confirmed dead in the disaster are from Palu. The regencies of Donggala, Sigi and Parigi Moutong - with a combined population of 1.2 million - had yet to be fully assessed.\n\n\'The death toll is believed to be still increasing, since many bodies were still under the wreckage, while many have not been reached,\' said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.\n\nThe cries from beneath the Roa-Roa Hotel, which appeared to have toppled over with its walls splintered like pickup sticks, went silent by Sunday afternoon.\n\nOfficials had estimated about 50 people could be inside.');

The first article can be found here.\n\nThe counter-terrorism landscape in Southeast Asia has fundamentally changed over the 15 years since Indonesia’s anti-terrorism laws were originally enacted. The emergence of a self-declared ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria energised a new generation of Indonesia’s Islamists, with more than 500 Indonesians travelling to ISIS controlled lands and returning – many in family groups.\n\nThe appeal of global Islamist ideology has radicalised young Indonesians via social media, without the need for travel or formal membership of Islamist organisations.\n\nWith advances in communications technology, the appeal of global Islamist ideology has radicalised young Indonesians via social media, without the need for travel or formal membership of Islamist organisations.\n\nA January 2016 rampage in central Jakarta, coordinated by Syrian-based ISIS operative Bahrum Naim and leader of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), Aman Abdurrahman, dramatically underlined the danger.\n\nYet it was the five-month siege of Marawi in the southern Philippines in 2017 by ISIS-linked militants that crystallised the threat posed to the region. The example set by the Maute group’s seizure of an urban centre in Mindanao presented a dangerous new prospect for Indonesia, prompting Jakarta and its regional partners to expedite a range of new intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism arrangements.\n\nBut even so, an effort by the President Joko Widodo to revise the 2003 anti-terrorism law to enhance its pre-emptive and preventive powers had languished for two years. The changes first sought in 2016 had become entangled in the increasing politicisation of Islam in Indonesia. It was a debate that illustrated the potent mix of populism and religion.\n\nIslamic identity embraced\n\nUnder the 32 year Suharto New Order regime in Indonesia, Islamic political parties in the country were emasculated and radical Islamists either eliminated by the armed forces or forced to flee overseas. Successive New Order governments banned the Islamic headscarf or hijab (jilbab) in both public schools and the civil service.\n\nIn Indonesia’s post-authoritarian socio-political context, however, Islamic identity has been increasingly embraced. With this has come a growing intolerance and pressure to conform, particularly on women.\n\nFor women’s civil society in Indonesia, the concern has been less about terrorist attacks, but more the increasing pressure, intimidation and coercion designed to restrict women’s agency and autonomy.\n\nWhen the anti-terrorism law was before the legislature, women’s organisations noted attempts by some factions, particularly the conservative Justice and Prosperity Party (PKS), to further erode women’s rights.\n\nMasjid Raya Mosque in Medan, Indonesia (Photo: Zol M/ Flickr)\n\nScrutiny and concern\n\nIn comparison to the 2003 law, the revised bill underwent a more extensive consultation and deliberation process, not just among the various political factions represented in the legislature (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR), but including women’s groups, the academe, religious groups and civil society organisations.\n\nMany non-government stakeholders were keen to ensure both the law met contemporary human rights standards and did not privilege repressive measures above the reintegration and rehabilitation of extremists.\n\nAmong the most contentious articles included the so-called “Guantanamo Article”, which provided for powers of arrest and detention without warrant for up to six months. Equally, both the electronic surveillance measures and planned revocation of citizenship for convicted terrorists on top of their prison sentences, proved contentious.\n\nThe citizenship article was later revoked as it contravened Indonesia’s citizenship law. Other articles were amended on expert advice, but the irony in a death penalty sanction for Islamists who sought glory as martyrs was not excised from the revised law.\n\nPolitical machinations\n\nDelays were also a consequence of political machinations. From November 2016, revisions to the anti-terrorism law were increasingly caught up in the charged political atmosphere of the Jakarta gubernatorial elections.\n\nThe election period and in the months preceding it, had seen a significant uptick in organised hate speech toward minority groups, such as Chinese, Christians, and more liberal proponents of Islam. Opponents used blasphemy charges under Indonesia’s criminal code to derail the chances of ethnic Chinese incumbent, Basuki Tjahaja (Ahok) Purnama, who in May 2017 was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.\n\nOpposition to Ahok involved the mobilisation, some of it spontaneous, most of it organised, of hundreds of thousands of protestors by hardline Islamic groups such as the Islamic Defender’s Front (FPI) and National Fatwa Guard Movement of the Council of Indonesian Ulema (GNPF-MUI) in November and December 2016.\n\nAs elite machinations intensified and rumours swirled about the loyalty of senior Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) commanders, concerns rose in the executive about the nation’s stability and cohesion. Within this heated political context, revisions of Indonesia’s anti-terrorism law proved highly contentious.\n\nThe conservative opposition faction in the legislature, comprised of PKS and the larger nationalist Greater Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), was concerned that the law should not become an instrument for the oppression of Islam or indeed, be used to thwart their own political agendas; particularly given the purported links between Gerindra and Islamist militia fomenting the anti-Ahok protests.\n\nThere was also a sense in quarters of the government, security forces, and civil society that the sympathies of conservative legislators were aligned closely with radical Islamic groups and their agendas.\n\nProtests in May 2017 against Jakarta\'s governor Basuki “Ahok” Purnama in the lead up to a blasphemy trial (Photo: Barcroft Media via Getty)\n\nStalemate shatters\n\nIt was the definition of terrorism and by extension, the security forces’ role in counter-terrorism, however, which proved most contentious. The Gerindra faction had proposed that the definition of terrorism include specific reference to “ideological and political motives”, arguing it would limit the potential for excess by security forces.\n\nYet this qualifying phrase was widely opposed – a member of the legislature’s expert team from the Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI), Poltak Partogi Nainggolan, characterised the additional phrase as unnecessarily complicating and claimed it would make it harder for the judiciary to prove ideological motive.\n\nA stalemate ensued.

The first article can be found here.\n\nThe counter-terrorism landscape in Southeast Asia has fundamentally changed over the 15 years since Indonesia’s anti-terrorism laws were originally enacted. The emergence of a self-declared ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria energised a new generation of Indonesia’s Islamists, with more than 500 Indonesians travelling to ISIS controlled lands and returning – many in family groups.\n\nThe appeal of global Islamist ideology has radicalised young Indonesians via social media, without the need for travel or formal membership of Islamist organisations.\n\nWith advances in communications technology, the appeal of global Islamist ideology has radicalised young Indonesians via social media, without the need for travel or formal membership of Islamist organisations.\n\nA January 2016 rampage in central Jakarta, coordinated by Syrian-based ISIS operative Bahrum Naim and leader of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), Aman Abdurrahman, dramatically underlined the danger.\n\nYet it was the five-month siege of Marawi in the southern Philippines in 2017 by ISIS-linked militants that crystallised the threat posed to the region. The example set by the Maute group’s seizure of an urban centre in Mindanao presented a dangerous new prospect for Indonesia, prompting Jakarta and its regional partners to expedite a range of new intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism arrangements.\n\nBut even so, an effort by the President Joko Widodo to revise the 2003 anti-terrorism law to enhance its pre-emptive and preventive powers had languished for two years. The changes first sought in 2016 had become entangled in the increasing politicisation of Islam in Indonesia. It was a debate that illustrated the potent mix of populism and religion.\n\nIslamic identity embraced\n\nUnder the 32 year Suharto New Order regime in Indonesia, Islamic political parties in the country were emasculated and radical Islamists either eliminated by the armed forces or forced to flee overseas. Successive New Order governments banned the Islamic headscarf or hijab (jilbab) in both public schools and the civil service.\n\nIn Indonesia’s post-authoritarian socio-political context, however, Islamic identity has been increasingly embraced. With this has come a growing intolerance and pressure to conform, particularly on women.\n\nFor women’s civil society in Indonesia, the concern has been less about terrorist attacks, but more the increasing pressure, intimidation and coercion designed to restrict women’s agency and autonomy.\n\nWhen the anti-terrorism law was before the legislature, women’s organisations noted attempts by some factions, particularly the conservative Justice and Prosperity Party (PKS), to further erode women’s rights.\n\nMasjid Raya Mosque in Medan, Indonesia (Photo: Zol M/ Flickr)\n\nScrutiny and concern\n\nIn comparison to the 2003 law, the revised bill underwent a more extensive consultation and deliberation process, not just among the various political factions represented in the legislature (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR), but including women’s groups, the academe, religious groups and civil society organisations.\n\nMany non-government stakeholders were keen to ensure both the law met contemporary human rights standards and did not privilege repressive measures above the reintegration and rehabilitation of extremists.\n\nAmong the most contentious articles included the so-called “Guantanamo Article”, which provided for powers of arrest and detention without warrant for up to six months. Equally, both the electronic surveillance measures and planned revocation of citizenship for convicted terrorists on top of their prison sentences, proved contentious.\n\nThe citizenship article was later revoked as it contravened Indonesia’s citizenship law. Other articles were amended on expert advice, but the irony in a death penalty sanction for Islamists who sought glory as martyrs was not excised from the revised law.\n\nPolitical machinations\n\nDelays were also a consequence of political machinations. From November 2016, revisions to the anti-terrorism law were increasingly caught up in the charged political atmosphere of the Jakarta gubernatorial elections.\n\nThe election period and in the months preceding it, had seen a significant uptick in organised hate speech toward minority groups, such as Chinese, Christians, and more liberal proponents of Islam. Opponents used blasphemy charges under Indonesia’s criminal code to derail the chances of ethnic Chinese incumbent, Basuki Tjahaja (Ahok) Purnama, who in May 2017 was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.\n\nOpposition to Ahok involved the mobilisation, some of it spontaneous, most of it organised, of hundreds of thousands of protestors by hardline Islamic groups such as the Islamic Defender’s Front (FPI) and National Fatwa Guard Movement of the Council of Indonesian Ulema (GNPF-MUI) in November and December 2016.\n\nAs elite machinations intensified and rumours swirled about the loyalty of senior Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) commanders, concerns rose in the executive about the nation’s stability and cohesion. Within this heated political context, revisions of Indonesia’s anti-terrorism law proved highly contentious.\n\nThe conservative opposition faction in the legislature, comprised of PKS and the larger nationalist Greater Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), was concerned that the law should not become an instrument for the oppression of Islam or indeed, be used to thwart their own political agendas; particularly given the purported links between Gerindra and Islamist militia fomenting the anti-Ahok protests.\n\nThere was also a sense in quarters of the government, security forces, and civil society that the sympathies of conservative legislators were aligned closely with radical Islamic groups and their agendas.\n\nProtests in May 2017 against Jakarta\'s governor Basuki “Ahok” Purnama in the lead up to a blasphemy trial (Photo: Barcroft Media via Getty)\n\nStalemate shatters\n\nIt was the definition of terrorism and by extension, the security forces’ role in counter-terrorism, however, which proved most contentious. The Gerindra faction had proposed that the definition of terrorism include specific reference to “ideological and political motives”, arguing it would limit the potential for excess by security forces.\n\nYet this qualifying phrase was widely opposed – a member of the legislature’s expert team from the Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI), Poltak Partogi Nainggolan, characterised the additional phrase as unnecessarily complicating and claimed it would make it harder for the judiciary to prove ideological motive.\n\nA stalemate ensued. The legislature and executive could not resolve differences over the definition. It lasted right up to 13 May this year, when Indonesia woke to the news of three successive suicide bombings of churches in the country’s second largest city of Surabaya, perpetrated by one family.\n\nNo-one could have foreseen a situation where extremists would transform their own children into improvised explosive devices.\n\nGreta Nabbs-Keller');
